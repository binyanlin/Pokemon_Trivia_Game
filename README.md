This app was a practice of using AJAX calls to access the pokemon API for information. I used some clever bootstrap CSS and jQuery components to create an interactive website that allows you play "Who's that Pokemon", while allowing you to control the amount of rounds and the regions that you care about. Professor Oak gives you a rating based on your score at the end as well. Click through the app a few times to give it a try!
